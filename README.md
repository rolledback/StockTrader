==========
This project is being created as a learning exercise in the fields of autonomous multi-agent systems and genetic learning algorithms. The general idea of the project is to run a simplified simulation of a stock market, which agents can then buy and sell stocks on. The project is currently very much a WIP and all components are likely to change greatly between now and completion.
