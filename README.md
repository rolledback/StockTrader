StockTrader
==========
This project is being created as a learning exercise in the fields of autonomous multi-agent systems and genetic learning algorithms. The general idea of the project is to run a simplified simulation of a stock market, which agents can then buy and sell stocks on. The project is currently very much a WIP and all components are likely to change greatly between now and completion.

A high level roadmap can be formed by looking at the issues page for the repository. That being said, the current plan is to get the the main components completely finished before writing any AIs. Large tasks left to be completed include object serialization, scenario defintions, and documentation. There is also a the possibility for Maven integration to be done in the future.
